# FHE Voting DApp - Complete Guide

## Overview

This is a **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Voting Decentralized Application** built on Ethereum, featuring privacy-preserving voting mechanisms using Zama's FHE protocol. The DApp enables completely private voting where individual votes remain encrypted throughout the entire process while still allowing for transparent vote counting.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- MetaMask browser extension installed
- Node.js installed on your system
- Access to Ethereum testnet (Sepolia) or local blockchain

### Running the DApp
```bash
cd D:\web3\dapp8\frontend
npm start
```
The application will start on `http://localhost:4002`

## üîê Key Features

### 1. **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**
- All votes are encrypted using Zama's TFHE library
- Vote tallying happens on encrypted data without revealing individual votes
- Results are computed homomorphically, maintaining complete privacy

### 2. **MetaMask Integration**
- Secure wallet connection
- EIP-712 structured data signing for vote authentication
- Real-time wallet balance and network detection

### 3. **Private Voting System**
- **Vote Options**: Yes/No voting with encrypted ballots
- **Privacy Guarantee**: Individual votes never revealed
- **Transparency**: Final results are verifiable on-chain

### 4. **Smart Contract Integration**
- Contract Address: `0x54aB0c14B0Edf56D08ce3183bc0a4A96D9dEdCe6`
- Built on Ethereum with Solidity ^0.8.28
- Deployed on Sepolia testnet for demonstration

## üéØ How It Works

### Step 1: Wallet Connection
1. Click "Connect MetaMask"
2. Authorize the connection in your MetaMask wallet
3. Your wallet address and balance will be displayed

### Step 2: Casting Your Vote
1. Choose your vote: "Vote Yes" or "Vote No"
2. Click the corresponding button
3. MetaMask will prompt you to sign an EIP-712 message
4. Your encrypted vote is submitted to the blockchain

### Step 3: Vote Verification
- Each vote is cryptographically signed
- The signature proves vote authenticity without revealing the choice
- All votes are stored encrypted on-chain

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Technology

### Zama FHE Protocol
```javascript
// Example: Encrypted vote processing
const encryptedVote = await encryptVote(voteChoice, userPublicKey);
const signature = await signVoteData(encryptedVote, userPrivateKey);
await submitEncryptedVote(encryptedVote, signature);
```

### EIP-712 Signing
The DApp uses EIP-712 for structured data signing:
```javascript
const domain = {
    name: "FHE Voting DApp",
    version: "1",
    chainId: 11155111, // Sepolia
    verifyingContract: contractAddress
};

const types = {
    Vote: [
        { name: "voter", type: "address" },
        { name: "encryptedChoice", type: "bytes" },
        { name: "timestamp", type: "uint256" }
    ]
};
```

### Key Functions

#### Wallet Connection
```javascript
async function connectToMetaMask() {
    const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({ 
        method: 'eth_requestAccounts' 
    });
    const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
    const signer = await provider.getSigner();
    return { provider, signer, address: accounts[0] };
}
```

#### Vote Submission
```javascript
async function submitVote(choice) {
    const { signer } = await connectToMetaMask();
    const signature = await signTypedDataWithMetaMask(
        domain, types, voteMessage, signer
    );
    // Submit encrypted vote to blockchain
}
